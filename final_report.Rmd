## Introduction ----

Media plays a key role in shaping public opinion and political outcomes. In the context of elections, the frequency and focus of media coverage on certain topics increases the salience of these issues among public and influences their vote behavior. This project aims to visualize the interplay between media coverage of the top "worries" of Swiss citizens and the outcomes of Swiss Federal elections 2023.

In this project, two main aspects are visualized using a shiny app:

  Salience of Worries in Media: 
    Examining the frequency of topics (top concerns of swiss citizens) in media articles to       gain insights into what issues are being emphasized in the public discourse leading up to     the elections.

  Voting Results of Swiss Federal Elections: 
    Map the voting results, focusing on the strength of the winning party of each canton in       the 2023 Federal Election. 

This might give a clearer idea of which issues were more discussed leading to the election and whether the goals of the majority party align with these prominently covered issues.


## Data Sources ----

1. Media Coverage Data:
    TheNewsAPI was utilized to gather media articles and related data from swiss sources.
    (thenewsapi.com)

2. Electoral Data:
    Voting results of the Swiss Federal elections were obtained from the open data platform,      opendata.swiss
    
3. Geographical Data:
     the shapefiles for canton boundaries, were sourced from Swisstopoâ€”the Federal Office of       Topography of Switzerland.

## Data Operationalization ----

Operationalization steps of Media Queries:

1) The Credit Suisse Worry Barometer is used as a key reference. It provides statistics on the    main concerns of Swiss citizens (such as healthcare, immigration, environment etc).
  (https://www.credit-suisse.com/sustainability/en/thought-leadership/worry-barometer.html)

2) For each major topic identified by the Worry Barometer, specific search terms were created,    to search for articles from TheNewsAPI. The focus was on articles published within the        three months leading up to the election day - to capture the most relevant and recent media    coverage that could influence or reflect voters' preferences.

```{r}
search_terms <- list(
  health = '"healthcare" | "health insurance"',
  environment = '"environment" + "protection" | "climate change"',
  retirement = '"AHV" | "retirement" + "provision"',
  eu_relations = 'EU',
  energy = '"Energy" + "issues"',
  immigration = '"Foreigners" | "Immigration"',
  inflation = '"Inflation"',
  housing = '"housing + costs" | "rent"',
  refugees = '"Refugees"',
  social_security = '"Social" + "security"'
)
```
   
3) The only Swiss news source used was swissinfo.ch (English articles). Other popular sources    were ignored as they publish articles in German, French, or Italian, which I do not speak,    making it difficult to create appropriate search terms in those languages.


## Exploratory Data Analysis ----


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "plots/most_covered_worry.png")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "plots/article_trends.png")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "plots/map.png")
```

## Challenge ----
The primary challenge was finding a suitable news API that included Swiss sources. Many APIs either lacked Swiss content, were discontinued, or required expensive subscriptions. After countless hours of searching TheNewsAPI was found (the most affordable option). Learning to use each API, understanding their documentation, and resolving errors was a time-consuming process that extended the project timeline


## Future Implementation ----

- Enhanced Search Queries: Expanding the set of search terms (by adding more keywords) could    help in filtering the data more effectively.

- Multilingual Support: Including german, french, and italian search terms is necessary. This   would allow to capture media outputs from all major news outlets across the country, meaning   a more comprehensive view of the media landscape.

- Historical Data Comparison: Collecting and including data from previous elections would be  
  valuable. We could better understand how media influence and public concerns have evolved  
  over time. This could be integrated into the Shiny app to allow users to compare how  
  different issues and party strengths have shifted from one election cycle to the next.
